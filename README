AZZMOS PROJECT
==============

The azzmos project (WIP) is attmpt to build a generic webcrawler that can be used for a 
variety of purposes.  Including:
	 Intelligient marketing;
	 Federal and international security; 
         Market Research;
and much more.

The intention of the project is that it is used with a indexing engine that will allow 
indivuals, corpoarations, government bodies and other communities a means to seek relevent
data from the web.

The project is in it's early sages and is far from a alpha release.  The alpha release 
is expected to only be tested on FreeBSD and OS X (XNU Kernels).  It will also be bound
to use a PostgresQL backend. It is intended that future releases allow for testing on
many more platforms and also allow for different backends such as Oracle and Sybase.

To install azzmos the following is required:
    PostgresQL compiled to run in multi-threaded mode (v 8.2.16)
    cURL development headers
    PCRE library and headers
