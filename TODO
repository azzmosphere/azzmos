1. Upload results to the database.

2. Make sure that regular expression is case insensitive

3. Add in table to contain the edges.

4. Add debugging information for DB connection

5. Normalize the FQP

6. Create tests for URIRegexGetFPQ

7. Currently URIExract has no awarness of the base 
   URI which can be specified in the content section of
   a HTML document (see RFC 1866),  this has to be added.

8. A sanity check using DNS should be done before a 
   URI is doenloaded, as well address qualification 
   and normalization.

9. Test to see if the URI is with a politeness policy

10.Remove irrelivent sections of the URI.

11.Check headers to see if the URI is a supported
   type.

12. Need to fix up the while loop in DownloadURI.  This should
    return back the entire string of URIs in a linked list and 
    then iterate through them.

BUGS
1. Not reading all URL's in the page.

2. Need to qualify the address when relitive
